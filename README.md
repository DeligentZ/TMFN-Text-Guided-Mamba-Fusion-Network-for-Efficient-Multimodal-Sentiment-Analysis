# TMFN-Text-Guided-Mamba-Fusion-Network-for-Efficient-Multimodal-Sentiment-Analysis
TMFN is a fusion network for efficient multimodal sentiment analysis, it consists a parameter-efficient adapter, a mamba-based single-layer encoder, a text-guided cross-attention, and employ text modalities as a semantic anchor in subsequent fusion stage.

The link of the TMFN's paper is as follows:

The next part is a readme that tell you how to use our code to achieve the TMFN, if you have any question pls contact me.
